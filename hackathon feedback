Disatro Sight
Very impressive project!
This is a very useful application for keeping track of world disasters.
Your code is built very well with routes,modules and controllers.
Good DRY code and I like how you connected to your own db with the server to act as your API.
You used a dotENV file which also shows how your code structure is good.
Your progress is noticed!
